Keylogger.py:-
  In this python code first we have installed "pynput" with the command "pip install pynput"
  Pyinput is used to get keystrples from the user's keyboard
  after importing in the first function on_press we start a loop and store all the keystrokes in an array
  in second function we record it and save it in a text file "Log.txt" 
  at the end we define that if the user clicks ESC key in his keyboard the loop will stop and the keylogger will end.
Log.txt:-
  in log.txt all the keystrokes are collected till the program is running
